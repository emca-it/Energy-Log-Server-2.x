### Sharing

The dashboard can be share with other Energy Log Server users as well
as on any page - by placing a snippet of code. Provided that it cans
retrieve information from Energy Log Server.

To do this, open the saved dashboard and click on the icon
![](/./media/media/image36.png) to the right of the query bar. A window
will appear with two gray bars. The content of the first one is used
to provide the dashboard in the page code, and the second is a link
that can be passed on to another user. There are two icons next to
them, the first is to shorten the length of the link, and second on
copies to clipboard the contest of the given bar
